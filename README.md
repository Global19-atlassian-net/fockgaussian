# Supplementary material for "A faster calculation of  Franck-Condon factors and Fock matrix elements of Gaussian unitaries using loop hafnians"

## Nicol√°s Quesada

The functions in fockgaussian and the jupyter notebook examples require [strawberryfields](https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields) and the [hafnian](https://github.com/XanaduAI/hafnian) library.
